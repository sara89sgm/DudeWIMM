Boil the Frog
=============
Boil the Frog  is a Spotify App that will create playlists that
gradually take you from one music style to another.  It is like the
proverbial story of the frog in the pot of water. If you heat the
water gradually, the frog wonâ€™t notice and will happily sit in the pot
until it becomes frog stew.  With Boil the Frog  you can do the same
thing musically.  Create a playlist that gradually takes your pre-teen
from Miley Cyrus to Miles Davis, or perhaps more perversely the Kenny
G fan to Cannibal Corpse.

To use, you must be enrolled in the Spotify Developer program.
Download the project and place it in your Spotify apps folder.  On a
mac this is in ~/Spotify.

Launch it by typing 'spotify:app:boilthefrog' in the Spotify search
bar.

Boil the Frog was created during the Music Apps Hack Weekend in
February 2012.
